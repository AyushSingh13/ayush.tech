# [Personal website](https://ayushsingh13.github.io)

The primary reason that has led to the creation of this blog is to relieve the people around from hearing me ramble on about the latest trends in JavaScript libraries or the latest, totally "world-changing", idea I am working on.

The technologies and libraries used to make this website include:

- GatsbyJS (with the beloved React, of course) :heart:
- styled-components

### Installation

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AyushSingh13/website.git
